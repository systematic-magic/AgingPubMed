   	PDF checks are the same as HTML checks with some exceptions. This page explains the cases where PDF requirements **differ** from HTML checks.
   	Please use a merge of HTML and PDF checks for PDF review. Aside from noted differences below, all elements of the HTML should match the PDF.

17. Supplementary Materials
---------------------------

.. Note::
	
	Supplementary materials are located in two places:

	1. HTML page  (after Materials and Methods section) - All supplementary materials are available here as separate downloads.

	2. PDF of the main manuscript (after References) - All supplementary materials that can be placed in a PDF are available here. Any materials that cannot fit in PDF due to formatting or size will have callouts to the HTML where they can be downloaded and viewed. 

	This check is for the supplementary materials in the PDF. Checks for supplementary materials downloads in the HTML can be found :ref:`here<supplementary_html_research_papers>`.


Supplementary materials should be located after the references of the main MS in the PDF.
