16. Supplementary Materials
---------------------------

.. Note::
	
	Supplementary materials are located in two places:

	1. HTML page  (after Materials and Methods section) - All supplementary materials are available here as separate downloads.

	2. PDF of the main manuscript (after References) - All supplementary materials that can be placed in a PDF are available here. Any materials that cannot fit in PDF due to formatting or size will have callouts to the HTML where they can be downloaded and viewed. 

	This check is for the supplementary materials in PDF. Checks for supplementary materials in the HTML can be found :ref:`here<supplementary_html_research_papers>`.


Supplementary materials should be located after the references of the main MS in the PDF.
