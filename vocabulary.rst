Sentence case
    Sentence case is the conventional way of using capital letters in a sentence. That is, you only capitalize the first letter of the first word – like you would in a sentence. Proper nouns (including abbreviations, gene names, journal titles, scientific databases, etc.) have initial capitals as well.

.. _title_case:
