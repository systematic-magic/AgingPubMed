   :alt: Author list separators
   :scale: 99%


3.4. Check the format of the author name. 

Allowed formats:

	+  :sample:`FirstName LastName`
	+  :sample:`FirstName MiddleName LastName`
	+  :sample:`FirstName MiddleName MiddleName LastName` (there can any number of middle names)
	+  :sample:`FirstName MN. LastName` (MN. are initials of middle names; up to 4 letters)
	+  :sample:`FirstName M.N. LastName` (M.N. are initials of middle names; up to 4 letters)
	+  :sample:`F. MiddleName LastName` (F. is an initial of first name)
	+  :sample:`F. MiddleName MiddleName LastName` (F. is initial of first name and there can any number of middle names)

.. Important::
	As a general rule, we don't want to keep initials for first names. Request the expanded name from the author in this situation. If the authors insist on a first initial, then the middle name(s) must be present and fully expanded. |br| |br|
	LastName **cannot** be presented as initial (even if authors insist on this). LastName should always be presented in full.


Please note that last names can be compound, can have prepositions, suffixes, prefixes or be :ref:`mononyms<mononym>`. For example:

	- Compound last names: :sample:`Garcia-Closas, Gomez Jimenez`
	- Last name related prepositions: :sample:`Van den Brandt, van der Ent`
	- Suffixes: :sample:`Williams 3rd, Rowland Jr`
	- Prefixes: :sample:`McCann, O'Kelly`
	- Mononym: :sample:`Govindjee`

If you see that author name does not comply to these standards, please contact corresponding author and ask to provide author name in correct format.

3.5. Check that each author name contains a number linked to the affiliation text (i.e. affiliation number). One author name can contain a few affiliation numbers.

.. image:: /_static/html_aff_texts_and_authors.png

	| :sample:`[N]` (where “N” is the order number of the corresponding reference)
	|
	| `Examples:`
	| :sample:`[1]`
	| :sample:`[1, 2]`
	| :sample:`[1–3]`
	| :sample:`[1, 3–4]`

	.. image:: /_static/callouts_format.png
		:alt: Callouts format
	|
	- Check that only comma (,) and :ref:`en dash<en_dash>` (–) are used as a separators. No other separators are allowed. 

	- Check that there is a space after comma (,) and no space before and after en dash (–).

	- Check that reference callouts are in :ref:`plain text<plain_text>` and a number (or numbers in case of ranges) is hyperlinked.

15.2. Check that callout number for each of the references is present in the text or is covered in the range of numbers. i.e. in the range of [1-3] reference 2 is not present in the text, but covered in the range. This case is acceptable. |br|
Callouts can be found in text, figures and tables.

15.3. Check that there are no callouts for non-existing references (i.e. there is a callout, but there is no reference).

15.4. Check that there are no references for which callouts are missing (i.e. there is a reference, but there is no callout for it).

15.5. Check that reference callouts appear in linear order throughout the manuscript. 1, 2, 3 and so on. Once a reference has initially been called out, it can be called out again in any order. For example, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 4 is OK. Sometimes callouts can appear to be out of linear order due to being called out in tables - This is OK as long as all other callouts are following linear order.

	If one or more references or callouts are missing or are being called out of linear order in the text, please contact author.

16.5. General Checks
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

16.5.1. Check for duplicates in the reference list. 

If you find duplicate references, please contact author and ask to correct the reference list along with renumbering reference call-outs.

16.5.2. Check for references translated into English from another language (usually you can spot those by keywords: translation, translated from, in Chinese, in French etc). Those references should comply to the following format:

   | :sample:`Author list. [Title of the article]. Journal Name. 1072; 1: 1-2.` (doi, if available) (PubMed link, if available)
   |
   | `Example:`
   | 34. Yang XM, Yang H. [Expression of high mobility group box-1 in the lung tissue and serum of patients with pulmonary tuberculosis]. Zhonghua Jie He He Hu Xi Za Zhi. 2013; 36:497-500.


16.5.3. Check for references containing journal title in English and original language (e.g. "International journal of cancer" and "Journal international du cancer"). Remove title in original language and leave English version. If there is just a "foreign language" version present, it is OK to leave that version (no need to find English one). Consult `PubMed <https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/>`_ if in doubt of the correct journal name.

16.5.4. Check for extra information in the references (i.e. in addition to "standard" information). Remove all extra information.
   
   | `Example:`
   | ":official publication of the society of…"


16.5.5. Remove any instances of “[Internet]”, "[pii]" Accessed dates (ex: “Accessed November 6, 2017.”) and empty (blank) doi.

16.5.6. Remove “PMID” and “PMCID” details, if present in any reference.

16.5.7. Check formatting for references that have been cited from supplemental issues. This information should appear in between the publishing year and semicolon in this format:

   | :sampleb:`(Suppl N)` (where “N” is the supplemental issue number)


	.. image:: /_static/suppl_issue_formatting.png
   	  	:alt: Supplemental issue formatting
   	  	:scale: 99%

16.5.8. Preprint articles are allowed in references. A couple of examples (not limited to) would be from sources such as `BioRxiv <https://www.biorxiv.org/>`_ and `Preprints <https://www.preprints.org/>`_.

- These should be formatted to the same standards as described above in :ref:`16.1<refs_author_list_html_research_papers>`, :ref:`16.2<reference_title_html_research_papers>` and :ref:`16.4<citation_data_other_journals_html_research_papers>` with the exception that a special ID number will typically be used in place of volume and page numbers.
