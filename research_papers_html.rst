   :alt: Author list separators
   :scale: 99%


2.3. Check the format of the author name. 

Allowed formats:

	+  :sample:`FirstName LastName`
	+  :sample:`FirstName MiddleName LastName`
	+  :sample:`FirstName MiddleName MiddleName LastName` (there can any number of middle names)
	+  :sample:`FirstName MN. LastName` (MN. are initials of middle names; up to 4 letters)
	+  :sample:`FirstName M.N. LastName` (M.N. are initials of middle names; up to 4 letters)
	+  :sample:`F. MiddleName LastName` (F. is an initial of first name)
	+  :sample:`F. MiddleName MiddleName LastName` (F. is initial of first name and there can any number of middle names)

.. Important::
	As a general rule, we don't want to keep initials for first names. Request the expanded name from the author in this situation. If the authors insist on a first initial, then the middle name(s) must be present and fully expanded. |br| |br|
	LastName **cannot** be presented as initial (even if authors insist on this). LastName should always be presented in full.


Please note that last names can be compound, can have prepositions, suffixes, prefixes or be :ref:`mononyms<mononym>`. For example:

	- Compound last names: :sample:`Garcia-Closas, Gomez Jimenez`
	- Last name related prepositions: :sample:`Van den Brandt, van der Ent`
	- Suffixes: :sample:`Williams 3rd, Rowland Jr`
	- Prefixes: :sample:`McCann, O'Kelly`
	- Mononym: :sample:`Govindjee`

If you see that author name does not comply to these standards, please contact corresponding author and ask to provide author name in correct format.

2.4. Check that each author name contains a number linked to the affiliation text (i.e. affiliation number). One author name can contain a few affiliation numbers.

.. image:: /_static/html_aff_texts_and_authors.png
	:scale: 99%
	:alt: Affiliation texts and authors

If there is only one affiliation text for all authors, then each author name should have "1" next to it.

   :alt: One affiliation for all authors
   :scale: 99%

2.5. Check that all affiliation numbers of the author list are separated by commas (,). No other separator is allowed.

2.6. Check that all affiliation numbers of the author list are formatted in superscript. See below.

	| `Examples of callout combinations:`
	| :sampleu:`Figure 1`
	| :sampleu:`Figure 3C`
	| :sampleu:`Figure 2B` :sample:`and` :sampleu:`2C` (note that there is no "s" at the end of "Figure" word)
	| :sampleu:`Figure 5B`:sample:`,` :sampleu:`5C`

15.5. General Checks
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

15.5.1. Check for duplicates in the reference list. 

If you find duplicate references, please contact author and ask to correct the reference list along with renumbering reference call-outs.

15.5.2. Check for references translated into English from another language (usually you can spot those by keywords: translation, translated from, in Chinese, in French etc). Those references should comply to the following format:

   | :sample:`Author list. [Title of the article]. Journal Name. 1072; 1: 1-2.` (doi, if available) (PubMed link, if available)
   |
   | `Example:`
   | 34. Yang XM, Yang H. [Expression of high mobility group box-1 in the lung tissue and serum of patients with pulmonary tuberculosis]. Zhonghua Jie He He Hu Xi Za Zhi. 2013; 36:497-500.


15.5.3. Check for references containing journal title in English and original language (e.g. "International journal of cancer" and "Journal international du cancer"). Remove title in original language and leave English version. If there is just a "foreign language" version present, it is OK to leave that version (no need to find English one). Consult PubMed if in doubt of the correct journal name.

15.5.4. Check for extra information in the references (i.e. in addition to "standard" information). Remove all extra information.
   
   | `Example:`
   | ":official publication of the society of…"


15.5.5. Remove any instances of “[Internet]”, "[pii]" Accessed dates (ex: “Accessed November 6, 2017.”) and empty (blank) doi.

15.5.6. Remove “PMID” and “PMCID” details, if present in any reference.
