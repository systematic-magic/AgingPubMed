====================================


1. Title
--------

1.1. Check that title is in :ref:`sentence case<sentence_case>`.

1.2. Check title spelling.

1.3. Check that title is written in black and bold font.

1.4. Check that capitalisation of scientific terms is correct.
We suggest the you use the :ref:`following procedure<correct_case_check>`, if in you are in doubt regarding this or that term.

1.5. Check that following Latin terms are written in italics: *in vivo, in vitro, in utero, in situ, via*. 
For other Latin terms and gene names either italics or :ref:`plain text<plain_text>` is acceptable.

2. Author List
--------------

2.1. Check that all author names in author list are separated by commas (,). No other separators allowed.

2.2. Check that there is no period (or any other punctuation mark) after the last author name.

   :alt: Author list separators
   :scale: 60%


2.3. Check the format of the author name. 

Allowed formats:

	+  :sample:`FirstName LastName`
	+  :sample:`FirstName MiddleName LastName`
	+  :sample:`FirstName MiddleName MiddleName LastName` (there can any number of middle names)
	+  :sample:`FirstName MN. LastName` (MN. are initials of middle names; up to 4 letters)
	+  :sample:`FirstName M.N. LastName` (M.N. are initials of middle names; up to 4 letters)
	+  :sample:`F. MiddleName LastName` (F. is an initial of first name)
	+  :sample:`F. MiddleName MiddleName LastName` (F. is initial of first name and there can any number of middle names)

.. Important::
	As a general rule, we don't want to keep initials for first names. Request the expanded name from the author in this situation. If the authors insist on a first initial, then the middle name(s) must be present and fully expanded. |br| |br|
	LastName **cannot** be presented as initial (even if authors insist on this). LastName should always be presented in full.


Please note that last names can be compound, can have prepositions, suffixes, prefixes or be :ref:`mononyms<mononym>`. For example:

	- Compound last names: :sample:`Garcia-Closas, Gomez Jimenez`
	- Last name related prepositions: :sample:`Van den Brandt, van der Ent`
	- Suffixes: :sample:`Williams 3rd, Rowland Jr`
	- Prefixes: :sample:`McCann, O'Kelly`
	- Mononym: :sample:`Govindjee`

If you see that author name does not comply to these standards, please contact corresponding author and ask to provide author name in correct format.

2.4. Check that each author name contains a number linked to the affiliation text (i.e. affiliation number). One author name can contain a few affiliation numbers.

.. image:: /_static/html_aff_texts_and_authors.png
	:scale: 60%
	:alt: Affiliation texts and authors

If there is only one affiliation text for all authors, then each author name should have "1" next to it. 

.. image:: /_static/html_one_affiliation_all_auth.png
   :alt: One affiliation for all authors
   :scale: 60%

2.5. Check that all affiliation numbers of the author list are separated by commas (,). No other separator is allowed.

2.6. Check that all affiliation numbers of the author list are formatted in superscript. See below.

.. image:: /_static/html_affiliation_numbers.png
   :alt: Affiliation Numbers

.. Note::
	
	Occasionally you can see a symbol (\*, #, \**, \*** etc) next to the author name together with affiliation number. This symbol is related to Author Notes. |br|

------------------

9.4.1. Check for duplicates in the reference list. 

If you find duplicate references, please contact production team and ask to correct the reference list.

   | :sample:`Author list. [Title of the article]. Journal Name. 1072; 1: 1-2.` (doi is optional)
   |

   | 34. Yang XM, Yang H. [Expression of high mobility group box-1 in the lung tissue and serum of patients with pulmonary tuberculosis]. Zhonghua Jie He He Hu Xi Za Zhi. 2013; 36:497-500.


9.4.3. Check for references containing journal title in English and original language (e.g. "International journal of cancer" and "Journal international du cancer"). Remove title in original language and leave English version. If there is just a "foreign language" version present, it is OK to leave that version (no need to find Eglish one).
