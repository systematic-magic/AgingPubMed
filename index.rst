Welcome to PubMed Standards documentation!
==========================================

The purpose of this document is to provide a simple but detailed guide to the realm of PubMed corrections.

Please compile all corrections into one email to send to production. If you have questions about a paper, please ask first, and then send to production after receiving an answer.

If you see that paper formatting does not comply with these standards, please address your concerns to vendors through JPS.

In general, if authors have an issue with a change we are suggesting, please raise the concern to Christopher as we can sometimes make special accommodations depending on the situation.

Seek approval from Olga while copying Christopher anytime an author requests any data changes and/or numerously time-consuming amounts of corrections.

Inquiries from authors about when their paper will be published or appear on PubMed should be forwarded to Olga.

Happy hunting!
