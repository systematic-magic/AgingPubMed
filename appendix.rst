.. _sentence_case:

Sentence case
    Sentence case is the conventional way of using capital letters in a sentence. That is, you only capitalize the first letter of the first word – like you would in a sentence. Proper nouns (including abbreviations, gene names, journal titles, scientific databases, etc.) have initial capitals as well.

    | `Examples:`
    | :sample:`The cat sat on the mat.`
    | :sample:`London is a capital of The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.`
    |

.. _title_case:

Title case
    Title case is the conventional way of using capital letters in a sentence. That is, you capitalize all principal words. Articles, conjunctions, and prepositions do not get capital letters unless they start the title.

    | `Examples:`
    | :sample:`Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.`
    | :sample:`Seven Habits of Effective People.`
    |

Alphabetical Figure Legend Panel Callouts
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Each figure legend should be formatted so that the first instance of each panel letter is called out in alphabetical order (Ex. A, B, A, C, B, D).

Could you please use the attached PDF to mark the necessary changes to bring your paper into accordance with this standard? Keep in mind that changes made to the panel letters in the figure or the legend may affect in-text callouts throughout the rest of your paper as well.
