WORD DOC: All Papers (except Editorials)
========================================

The Word doc can be downloaded by clicking the “Download MS” link at the top-right corner of HTML page (The paper must be accessed by the special link shown in :ref:`Accessing Papers<paper_access>` section in order for the Word doc link to be visible).

Request MS from Alex and Christopher if one is unavailable.

.. Important::
 Open the Word doc with Microsoft Word (other word processors such as Google Docs and Apple Pages do not reliably render the correct font) and with the spelling and grammar checker enabled.

 Word docs can be uploaded to the team Google Drive if necessary, but it would not be advisable to open them there as the font will be permanently corrupted if saved as a Google Doc, which could be done inadvertently due to Google's auto-save feature.

1. Spelling

3. Font
-------

3.1. Report any corrupted or incorrect font that you notice while checking spelling and grammar as a correction to production.

.. note::
 We report these errors because the final PDF is directly generated from the Word doc. Still report these issues even if there is not an evident effect in the current PDF so as to avoid any potential future issues.

- We only use Times New Roman and fonts: :calibri:`Calibri`
