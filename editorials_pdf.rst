3.3. Check that author’s name does NOT contain titles and/or degrees (e.g. Dr., Ph.D., M.D., etc.).

   :alt: Editorials Author format

3.5. Check the format of the author name. 

Allowed formats:

	+  :sample:`FirstName LastName`
	+  :sample:`FirstName MiddleName LastName`
	+  :sample:`FirstName MiddleName MiddleName LastName` (there can any number of middle names)
	+  :sample:`FirstName MN. LastName` (MN. are initials of middle names; up to 4 letters)
	+  :sample:`FirstName M.N. LastName` (M.N. are initials of middle names; up to 4 letters)
	+  :sample:`F. MiddleName LastName` (F. is an initial of first name)
	+  :sample:`F. MiddleName MiddleName LastName` (F. is initial of first name and there can any number of middle names)

.. Important::
	As a general rule, we don't want to keep initials for first names. Request the expanded name from the author in this situation. If the authors insist on a first initial, then the middle name(s) must be present and fully expanded. |br| |br|
	LastName **cannot** be presented as initial (even if authors insist on this). LastName should always be presented in full.


Please note that last names can be compound, can have prepositions, suffixes, prefixes or be :ref:`mononyms<mononym>`. For example:

	- Compound last names: :sample:`Garcia-Closas, Gomez Jimenez`
	- Last name related prepositions: :sample:`Van den Brandt, van der Ent`
	- Suffixes: :sample:`Williams 3rd, Rowland Jr`
	- Prefixes: :sample:`McCann, O'Kelly`
	- Mononym: :sample:`Govindjee`

If you see that author name does not comply to these standards, please contact corresponding author and ask to provide author name in correct format.

3.6. Check that author names do not have affiliation numbers.

3.7. Check that there are no affiliations listed for authors (there must be no affiliations on the page).

.. _figures_pdf_editorials:

5. Figures
----------

.. Note::
	
	Only one figure should be used for editorials. |br|

5.1. Check that figure image has text and graphics which are clear and large enough to read (i.e. image text is not smaller than article text itself).

If image is hard to read, please contact Production team and ask to provide clearer images. If Production team does not have better images, then contact corresponding author.

5.2. Check whether figures have :ref:`panel letters<figure_pannel>`. Both lower case and upper case panel letters are allowed. However, they should be used consistently: either all figures have lower case panel letters or all have upper case letters. Mix of formats is not allowed.

5.3. Check the figure description text (figure legend):

	- Check that figure legend has a figure number:

	|	:sampleb:`Figure N.` (where “N” is a number of the figure)

	- Check that number is followed by period (.).

	- Check that figure number is formatted in bold and coloured in black.

	- If figure number is followed by text, then check that the first sentence of that text is formatted in bold and coloured in black. The rest of the text should be in :ref:`plain text<plain_text>`.

	|	:sampleb:`Figure 1. First sentence of legend text in sentence case.` :sample:`Second sentence and rest of text.`
	
	.. image:: /_static/html_figure_number.png

   	  	:scale: 99%

	`Exclusion:` if first sentence contains :ref:`panel letters<figure_pannel>`, then it should be formatted in :ref:`plain text<plain_text>`.

	|	:sampleb:`Figure 1.` :sample:`First sentence of legend text containing panel letter (`:sampleb:`A`:sample:`) and letter (`:sampleb:`B`:sample:`) in a sentence case. Second sentence and rest of text.`


	.. image:: /_static/html_figure_number_exception.png
   	  	:alt: Figure number
   	  	:scale: 99%

	- If figure image has :ref:`panel letters<figure_pannel>`, then check that reference to each panel is present in figure legend. Reference is denoted by panel letter and is formatted in bold.

	| This is the allowed format for the panel reference (case of letter should match letter case in figure image):

	|	:sample:`(`:sampleb:`A`:sample:`)` or :sample:`(`:sampleb:`a`:sample:`)` - i.e. letter wrapped parentheses ()

	| :ref:`Panel letters<figure_pannel>` can be combined in different ways in the figure legend text:

	| :sample:`(`:sampleb:`A` :sample:`and` :sampleb:`B`:sample:`)`

	.. image:: /_static/html_fig_reference_br_anb.png

	| Same variations are allowed for lower case :ref:`panel letters<figure_pannel>`.


	If a reference to :ref:`panel letter<figure_pannel>` is missing, then please ask author to provide one.

5.4. Check figure callouts in the text:

	- Check the format of figure callouts (no other variations allowed):

	| :sample:`Figure 1`

	.. image:: /_static/pdf_figure_callouts.png
   	  	:alt: Figure callouts
   	  	:scale: 99%

    |
	If figure has panels, then callout can have a letter (letter case should be the same as on figure image):

   	|
	| :sample:`Figure 1A`
	| :sample:`Figure 1a`

	.. image:: /_static/html_fig_callout_full_letters.png
   	  	:alt: Figure number
   	  	:scale: 99%

	| `Examples of callout combinations:`
	| :sample:`Figure 1`
	| :sample:`Figure 1C`
	| :sample:`Figure 1B` :sample:`and` :sample:`1C` (note that there is no "s" at the end of "Figure" word)
	| :sample:`Figure 1B`:sample:`,` :sample:`1C`
	| :sample:`Figure 1E`:sample:`–`:sample:`1G`

	.. image:: /_static/html_fig_callout_variations.png
   	  	:alt: Figure number
   	  	:scale: 99%

   	|
	- Check that the word "Figure" as well as number (and letter) is formatted in :ref:`plain text<plain_text>` and not hyperlinked.
